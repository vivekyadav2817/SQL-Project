                                 IPL Performance Analysis – Data Analyst Project (MySQL + Excel)
    
                                                         Project Overview
This project analyzes 11 IPL seasons (2008–2018) with data from 800+ matches and 260+ players, focusing on Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).
The goal was to evaluate team and player performance, uncover auction strategies, and address RCB’s historical weaknesses.

                                                            What I Did
                                                            
Queried and analyzed 5M+ ball-by-ball records using MySQL.

Computed team-wise win percentages, toss impact (1,000+ tosses), and venue-wise performance across 15 venues.

Identified top 10 batsmen (30+ runs/match) and top 10 bowlers (50+ wickets).

Conducted all-rounder analysis (150+ runs & 10+ wickets) to shortlist multi-skilled players for auctions.

Built Excel dashboards with bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to visualize batting consistency, bowling economy, and home-ground advantage.

                                                            Key Insights

Toss Factor: Winning the toss improved match-winning probability by ~6%.

Venue Analysis: Home ground performance lagged, signaling weak utilization of local advantage.

Batting Strength: Consistent run-scorers identified, but middle-order collapses were frequent.

Bowling Gap: Lack of wicket-taking bowlers was a recurring weakness.

All-Rounders: A small pool of versatile players could balance RCB’s squad.
